# Chatbot Frontend

This is the frontend part of an intelligent academic chatbot developed for the Faculty of Science and Technology of Tangier (FSTT). The chatbot leverages advanced AI technologies, including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuned language models, to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses to students' and instructors' inquiries.

## Features

- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines retrieval-based and generation-based techniques for accurate and natural responses.
- **Fine-tuned Language Model**: The LLaMA 3 language model is fine-tuned on a custom corpus related to FSTT, ensuring domain-specific understanding.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, the interface provides a smooth and responsive experience.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Users can engage in real-time conversations with the chatbot, receiving instant responses.

## Technologies Used
